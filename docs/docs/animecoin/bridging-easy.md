# Bridging ANIME â€“ The Easy Way

Use Relay to bridge ANIME with a simple UI â€“ no manual contract steps.

---

## âœ… Why it's is easy

Relay now supports bridging the AnimeChain native token (ANIME). You can access a preconfigured link that includes AnimeChain directly:

`https://relay.link/bridge/ethereum?includeChainIds=6167f9a0-84dc-4296-8a26-2bb3cc56dc2c&fromChainId=69000&toCurrency=0x4dc26fc5854e7648a064a4abd590bbe71724c277`

- Opens Relay with AnimeChain included
- Starts from AnimeChain mainnet chain ID `69000` by default
- Pre-fills ANIME currency on the destination

You can still change source/destination chains in the UI if you need L1 â†” L3 or L2 â†” L3.

## Notes

- Make sure your wallet is connected to the correct source network when starting the bridge.
- Gas and fees vary by path (L1â†”L2, L2â†”L3, L1â†”L3). L1 typically has higher gas costs.
