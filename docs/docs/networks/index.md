# Networks Overview

AnimeChain operates on two networks to serve different use cases:

## ðŸŸ¢ Mainnet - Production Ready

**AnimeChain Mainnet** is the production network where real value transactions occur.

- **Purpose:** Production applications and real asset transfers
- **Security:** Full security guarantees from Arbitrum and Ethereum
- **Tokens:** Real ANIME tokens with actual value
- **Uptime:** Enterprise-grade reliability

## ðŸ§ª Testnet - Safe Development

**AnimeChain Testnet** is the development network for testing and experimentation.

- **Purpose:** Development, testing, and learning
- **Security:** Same security model as mainnet, but with test tokens
- **Tokens:** Free test tokens from our faucet
- **Reset:** Network may be reset during development
